I'm a recent PhD turning to data science. 

In my PhD, I used machine
learning and text mining to show that people's everyday online behaviors
-- such as the text of our tweets -- can predict a variety of deep
psychological facts about us as individuals. For example, I showed your
tweets are predictive of your decision-making and your Reddit posts may
reveal whether you have a mental illness. 

Now, I'm starting an Insight Data Science Fellowship, and I'm excited to
apply these techniques to data science.
