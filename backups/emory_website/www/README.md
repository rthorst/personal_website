# Academic Responsive (AR) Website Template

## A Responsive HTML5/CSS3 template for setting up an academic website.

This template is implemented in Bootstrap (a popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web). The template has been tested on iOS, Windows Phone, Android, Chrome, Safari and other browsers. Some of its features require external free components (e.g., Google Custom Search for site-search, Twitter widget for news, Smartbib for publication indexing). Additionally, having a CV in LATEX format will help to automate the generation of material and streamline consistency between your CV and your website. You will need to edit the sources with a text editor or a capable WYSIWYG editor.

The original idea for setting up this template was to make an academic profile easily accessible from a smartphone.

The template is free and open to reuse under a CC BY 4.0 licence.

Enjoy!
